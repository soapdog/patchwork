# v4.5.0: New Search Implementation

Poncho Wonky just got a brand new search engine implementation. This will require the posts in your database to be indexed and saved. All this processing happens mostly in the background but it can take a long time, so the first time you launch Poncho Wonky 4.5.0, it will be a bit clunky until it stops indexing.

From then onwards, each time you launch the app, it will incrementally update the index. This will cause app launches to be slower, but in return you get a search that works really well.

Search is disabled while the index is loading.
