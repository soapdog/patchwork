# v4.3.3: Indexing troubles

After I upgraded `ssb-db 19.x` to `ssb-db 20.x`, private messages stopped displaying.

It turned out the jump from those major versions required a cascade of upgrades to other dependencies that were hard to track and apparently maybe would cause breaking behaviours to Patchwork.

Patchwork maintainers in the past decided against upgrading.

I tried upgrading and failed. 

The main reason to upgrade was a fix for the _index overflow bug_. In this update I am reverting to `ssb-db 19.x` and backporting that fix into that version. So we get the fix but we don't get all the changes that came with the _20.x_ versions.

This update may cause your Patchwork to be unstable. It will rebuild indexes as needed, but if it becomes strange there is a new page under the `MORE` button called _Troubleshooting Tools_. You an use it to rebuild all your indexes or just some of them.
