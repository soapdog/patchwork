# Changes to SSB database

The 4.3.0 release contains a much needed upgrade to the SSB database routines to tackle a potential bug that affects people with larger social graphs.

This upgrade may cause your indexes to be out of sync and Patchwork will rebuild your indexes as needed. 

In some rare circumstances, you might end up seeing only messages that are really old, as if your Patchwork is stuck in the past. Don't worry, things are alright, it is just your indexes that got borked. 

If this happens to you, click the `MORE` button and go to `Settings`. Inside settings there is a section that allows you to force reindexing your database. Just be aware that depending on the size (aka how long you been on SSB and how long your contacts been on SSB), this process can take several minutes.

On the rare occasions where Patchwork gets stuck reindexing, as in you can't see any progress for a very long time, you can quit Patchwork and relaunch it. Reindexing will thus resume.

I try to avoid updates that may cause such unstable moments, but solving this bug is important and once you got your indexes back — something that should happen without any issues for most of the cases — you'll be in a safer position to keep enjoying SSB for years to come.
